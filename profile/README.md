### Hi, this is derisk-ai 👋

- 🔭 We're a team, currently working on exploring next-generation risk intelligence architecture and application paradigms through AI-native technology based on LLMs.

- 🚀 Our vision is to provide every production system with a 7 * 24H AI teammate in the future, constantly safeguarding your system's stability and security, freeing you from tedious operations and risk management tasks.

### Community
Over the past two years, we established the [DB-GPT](https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT) project. 🏗️ To achieve better community collaboration and development, we decided to maintain a set of core foundational framework modules together with the [eosphoros-ai](https://github.com/eosphoros-ai) community. Based on this foundation, we will independently derive capabilities in the risk and data domains. 🔄 At the same time, to make each community's responsibilities and goals more focused, we decided to develop each field in the form of independent communities, with each community focusing on research and applications in their respective domains.

The DeRisk-AI community is dedicated to building AI-native risk intelligence systems. 🛡️ We hope our community can provide you with better services, and we also hope that you can join us to create a better future together. 🤝
